# WebPuzzleGame
A simple web puzzle game written in vanilla javascript. Used a CSS Framework that is new to me and that is Bulma. Currently, this is only available for web view. In the future, I might make it tablet and mobile friendly.
# Description
1. I wanted to show off my JavaScript skills learnt from the holidays. This will include loops and a scrambling array function that uses O(n) time complexity.
2. I went ahead and tried out Bulma. I made some responsive objects but currently they are noot suited for tablet and mobile viewing.
3. There is 3 difficulties and 3 puzzles for each. Go ahead and try out!
4. Demo is hosted at https://bennygoh.tk/WebPuzzleGame
