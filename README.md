# WebPuzzleGame
A simple web puzzle game written in vanilla javascript. Used a CSS Framework that is new to me and that is Bulma. Currently, this is only available for web view. In the future, I might make it tablet and mobile friendly.
# Description
1. I wanted to show off my JavaScript skills learnt from the holidays. This will include loops and a scrambling array function that uses O(n) time complexity.
2. I went ahead and tried out Bulma. I made some responsive objects but currently they are not suited for tablet and mobile viewing.
3. There is 3 difficulties and 3 puzzles for each. Go ahead and try out!
4. Cropping of the images and the thumbnails is mostly produced with photoshop.
5. There are some bugs within the game such as the alert being too early when the user moves the final puzzle piece, and also when the puzzle + turns is not stopped after the user wins. Too lazy to fix those bugs so in the future if i am feeling very productive I will go ahead and fix it. 
6. Demo is hosted at https://bennygoh.tk/WebPuzzleGame
